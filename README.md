# Binary-Classifier
I  have taken just the first element of the MNIST dataset which turns out to be a 5 and used Binary Classifier to classify it as True or False. I have used Stochastic Gradient Descent to accomplish this task. So the classifier returns true if it sees 5 or False if a 5 is not present. So the second element happens to be 0 and thus it returns False.
